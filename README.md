This project focuses on cleaning raw sales data using Microsoft Excel to prepare it for analysis. Key steps included removing null and missing values,eliminating duplicate rows. Dates were converted to a consistent format, and column headers were cleaned and renamed to be clear and lowercase. All preprocessing was done using Excel.
